I'm an PhD Candidate at the Department of Economics of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. My research interests are mainly related to Econometrics, with an emphasis on Inference and Identification in Nonparametric and Semiparametric models, but i'm also hold interested in Industrial Organization, especially in the context of Urban Economics. 

I'm currently working as a Research Assistant for Professors [Ariaster Chimeli](https://ariasterchimeli.wordpress.com), [Klenio Barbosa](https://kleniobarbosa.wordpress.com) and [Rodrigo Moita](https://sites.google.com/site/rodmoita). However, i'm always looking forward to new opportunities for future assistantships.

I'd be very happy to make new acquaintaces in Academia and Non-Academia! If you want to talk my inbox is always open.

My doctoral advisor is Professor [Luis Alvarez](https://luisfantozzialvarez.github.io).
